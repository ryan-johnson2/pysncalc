## Introduction

Pysncalc is a simple CLI subnet calculator I wrote while in a CCNA prep course. Its purpose was to help me practice subnetting by having to think through the logic and implementing the code to automatically create a subnet.

## Running the Script

The script is simply run as a CLI tool with command line options.
